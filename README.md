# My Habit Tracking APP Project

The HabitTracker app is designed to provide users with an easy way to track and analyze their habits. 

## About the project?

Have you ever wondered how to successfully build new routines or maintain consistency with your habits? 
This habit-tracking application provides a robust backend solution to help users:

- Create and manage customizable habits tailored to their goals.
- Track daily, weekly and monthly completions to stay accountable.
- Analyze their progress with powerful insights trough streak tracking.
  
The application is designed for scalability and data persistence. The system is split into three core components to ensure a clean and modular design: a command-line interface (CLI), an analytical module for logic and insights, and a database module to handle all storage and retrieval operations. It uses SQLite for storing user and habit information. Libraries like datetime are leveraged for precise date calculations, such as tracking streaks and determining periodicity. Additionally, user passwords are securely hashed using Pythonâ€™s hashlib library to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user data.

This project was developed as a practical assignment for exploring object-oriented and functional programming concepts in Python.
